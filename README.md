# üöÄ Router Reboot Automation

Rebooting your router‚Ä¶ what a hassle, right?

You could do it the old-fashioned way: manually power it off, or log into the admin portal and navigate the menus to hit that elusive reboot button‚Äîtime-consuming and tedious.
But what if you could simply double-click a batch file, sit back, and watch it perform the reboot flawlessly every time? That‚Äôs the magic this project brings.

A headless Python automation script that safely performs a reboot. Fully configurable via JSON for credentials, URLs, and button selectors. Ideal for routine network maintenance and remote administration.
